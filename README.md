joyboy.nav

Joy is a sentiment analysis interface. 
In its current form, it's a bit of a 
deliberately naive single-page HTML 
that responds to joy! (and to an 
extent, absurdity)...

Currently using hard-coded emotional 
filters, Joy cheerfully celebrates 
anything that doesn't contain explicit 
bad words.

It isn't broken AI so much as innocent 
hard-coding and animation - as much a 
working demo as it is an indicator, 
in these AI times, I hope this can be 
a reminder of the strength of imagination.

I think Joy is cute, stylish and in 
future iterations very, very soon, 
I hope to sync existing structures of 
actual moral reasoning to bring a more 
genuine delight through its existing 
half of understanding context.
